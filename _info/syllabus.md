# About the Course

## Course Description:

Video Game Programming is a hands-on project-based course where students will apply computer science technical skills to video game projects supported by the instructor and a community of peers. Students taking this course will have an opportunity to focus and create software for various technical aspects in video game development.

This is a 4 unit course where units are awarded based on consistent progress on assignments and/or individual projects. Instruction and hands-on project work will be done in lectures where students are expected to bring their own laptop computers. If the student does not own a computer, then they should check with the instructor for alternative arrangements.

This course counts as an upper-division elective for CCS Computing students. Non CCS Computing students will be considered by request based on programming experience and available space in the course.s
